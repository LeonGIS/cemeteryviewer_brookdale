	    <p>The <b>Tax Parcel Viewer</b> provides the general public and other interested parties local government property tax and assessment information and supplements that information with lifestyle and internet broadband information for a given neighborhood.  It is a single application that can be deployed by local governments and used by citizens on a desktop PC, mobile phone, and tablet device.<br/><br/>To locate a parcel, simply click on the map or enter an address or parcel number in the search box and select a parcel from the list.</p>
	    <h4><u>Using the Application</u></h4>
	    <p>This application is named the Tax Parcel Viewer.  It offers a map-based view of tax parcel information that enables supporting agencies, organizations and the general public to locate an area of interest and review common information stored typically in the local government’s computer aided mass appraisal (CAMA) and tax receivables database.   It offers a standard overview of property data in a community for real estate professionals and other consumers so they can view this information on all homes as they walk or drive through neighborhoods.<br/><br/>Users are able to search for a specific address or parcel number, view authoritative property characteristics, sales and foreclosure information, and email this information to a friend or co-worker. They can also provide feedback to local governments so the quality of parcel boundaries and associated characteristics improve over time.</p>
        <h4><u>Finding an Area of Interest</u></h4>
        <p>There are three primary ways to identify an area of interest. You can interact directly with the map and click on a parcel when you've located it. You can also use your current location or finally search for a parcel using a full or partial address, Parcel ID, or subdivision/condo name.</p>
        <h4><u>Map Based Navigation</u></h4>
        <p>There are several ways to interact with the map:<br /><br />1. Use the base map switcher (not available on smartphone) to select the base map you'd like to interact with<br />2. Hold down the shift key and drag a box on the map to zoom in<br />3. Hold Down Ctrl+Shift to zoom out<br />4. Roll your mouse roller to zoom in/out<br />5. Drag the zoom slider to zoom in/out</p>

When a user accesses the Tax Parcel Viewer on a desktop PC or tablet device, reports can be generated for one or more parcels and added to the application’s shopping cart as they are created.  The shopping cart can be configured by the local government to provide maps and reports to users free of charge, or for a fee through integration with the Paypal Express Checkout API.</p>
